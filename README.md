## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Quick Setup

The easiest way to set up the application is to use the provided setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This script will:

- Prompt you for your Supabase URL and anon key
- Create a `.env` file with your credentials
- Check for the required model files
- Optionally install dependencies

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blur-vault.git
   cd blur-vault
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Supabase:

   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the SQL from `setup-supabase.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor
   - Copy your Supabase URL and anon key

4. Configure environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
     NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Helper Scripts

The application includes several helper scripts to simplify setup and deployment:

- `npm run setup` - Set up local development environment
- `npm run setup-supabase` - Set up Supabase tables and functions
- `npm run setup-github` - Set up GitHub repository secrets for deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Build the application for deployment
- `npm run prepare-deploy` - Prepare the application for manual deployment

### Face Detection Models

The application uses face-api.js models for face detection. These models are loaded from the `/public/models` directory. The required model files are:

- `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json`
- `tiny_face_detector_model-shard1`

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This application can be deployed to GitHub Pages with Supabase as the backend. A GitHub Actions workflow is included to automate the deployment process.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Set up repository secrets:
   - Go to your repository settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as repository secrets
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch
4. Configure Supabase authentication settings:
   - Set the Site URL to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://username.github.io/CursorDemo/`)
   - Add the same URL to the Redirect URLs

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).
